# North Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest soil organic carbon data tidying
Soil profile and soil organic carbon stock data for the North Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (NPCTR) as well as data tidying code from Desira Miller.

Goals
1. Restructure and tidy the soil profile dataset
2. Recompute soil organic stocks as summary tables of the raw soil profile data
3. Add more soil organic carbon data as available
4. Release the updated soil profile and soil organic carbon datasets on the Dryad repository 

The paper describing the original data compilation and regional analysis is McNicol et al. (2019) [https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaed52].

The original dataset and soil organic carbon map is available via a Dryad data respository [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5jf6j1r].
